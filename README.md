# Flask Menu Application
Code Tacoma event following Udacity Full Stack Foundations, Part 3

The Udacity Course can be found here: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud088

This repo uses Anaconda but any virtual environment manager should be fine.

Extend this project to music, shoes, art galleries, recipes, books, clients, and well anything really.  

We're even on the Internet, we have our own webpage! https://codetacoma.github.io/FlaskMenuApplication/
